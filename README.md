Final project at Technigo bootcamp 2018.


âœ¨ COLLECT THE STARS ðŸ’«


Tell us where in the world you are and we'll let you know if it'll be a clear sky to see the stars and which constellations you could see tonight.


You can log in to save your collected stars and update your collection when you've seen a new one. Most of us will need to travel to see all constallations - only countries along the equator have all constallations pass across the sky.
